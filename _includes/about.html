                <p><font size="4px"> I am a Microbiologist and Mycologist, fascinated with all things micro and fungi. </font></p>
                <p><font size="4px"> Taniaâ€™s research has been primarily focused on studying and understanding complex microorganisms called black yeasts. Black yeasts have been found on almost every surface including: common locations such as: buildings, dish washers and marble statues to the most extreme environments, such as: within porous rocks in the Antarctic, on the walls of the Chernobyl reactor, in hyper saline environments and even in the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients. Tania has been isolating these enigmatic yeasts from a variety of different environments, specifically features called biological soil crusts. Desert Biological soil crusts or biocrusts are a complex association of multiple different microorganisms working together to survive the extremes of the desert. Tania is interested in what black yeast functional roles are in these complex associations and if they provide a sunscreen protection to the rest of the feature due to their high melanin content. Tania has also isolated black yeasts from the patina of rock surfaces and from tar soaked soils collected from the La Brea Tar Pits. She hopes to bring more attention to the potential of these yeasts, especially as model organisms to study extremotolerance to high heat, desiccation and high UV.
